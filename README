This is my as-yet unnamed implementation of Tuxedo, or enough of Tuxedo to be seriously
interesting.

Documentation for this was available from the Open Group's website.  Required reading:
 Distributed TP: The TX (Transaction Demarcation) Specification
 Distributed TP: The XATMI Specification

There's something which, once upon a time, in a different project, used to be called a
"switchboard".  It got turned into "the server", and then "server"; and now I'm turning
it back to "the switchboard".  Beware the word "server"; ask yourself, "which one?"

Messages between the switchboard and a client is handled in two halves.  One half resides
in the tx and xatmi libraries, and is implemented in files called "tpxxxx.c", which "put
the arguments on the wire to the switchboard."  The other half, residing in the switchboard
itself and implemented in files called "svrxxxx.c", are the message handlers.  Additional
files perform all actual I/O for messages.

There are three major objects produced from these files:

* implementation of TX
* implementation of XATMI
* switchboard, to match

Makefile

dump.c: diagnostics.

byteorder.c: Intel-specific conversion of numbers from network to host byte-order.  Needs removal.
byteorder.h: must be a standard for this???

queue.c: implement list C pseudo-object.
queue.h: header for above

SWITCHBOARD
===========
tpserver.c: the switchboard
server.h: only for inclusion by xatmi implementation functions.
libxatmi.h: only for inclusion by xatmi implementation functions.
advert.c: .. advertisement routines.
client.c: .. client routines.
service.c: .. service routines.
transaction.c: .. transaction routines.
svracall.c: .. message handlers.
svradvertise.c: ..
svrgetrply.c: ..
svrreturn.c: ..
svrservice.c: ..
svrunadvertise.c: ..
svrio.c: message i/o routines.  (different routines used in clients.)

XATMI
=====
xatmi.h: this is a standard include file as defined by the Open Group.
tpfree.c: tpbuffer support.
tpalloc.c: ..
